name: knowledge-vault
description: Manage persistent project knowledge in the user's Knowledge Vault, including project/vault discovery, note-first lookup, vault initialization and normalization, automatic knowledge capture, architecture and ADRs, patterns, bugs, enhancements, investigations, work-in-progress, sessions, reports, and migration. MUST be used when durable knowledge is established during a task, even when the user never asks for notes, and when the user says "remember this", "save this workflow", or "don't do that again". Never store transcripts, secrets, or cheap-to-rediscover information.

# Knowledge Vault

## Project Discovery

1. Resolve the project root from the nearest Git root, project metadata, or working directory.
2. Resolve the project identity in this order:
   - `.project-agent.md`
   - explicit project metadata
   - package/project name
   - Git repository name
   - root directory name
3. Normalize the identifier for filesystem use:
   - lowercase
   - trim whitespace
   - convert spaces and underscores to hyphens
   - remove unsafe characters
   - collapse repeated hyphens
4. Resolve the knowledge root to:

   `~/Documents/KnowledgeVault/<project-identifier>/`

   unless `.project-agent.md` explicitly overrides it.

5. Keep global GENTJIN configuration project-agnostic.

## Workflow Memory

Use workflow memory for recurring commands, personal automation patterns, and repeatable computer tasks that are likely to be requested again. Keep cross-project workflows in the global GENTJIN workflow store and project-specific workflows in the current project vault.

Use `~/Documents/KnowledgeVault/gentjin/workflows/` as the default global workflow store unless project metadata provides an explicit override. Use `<project-knowledge-root>/workflows/` for project-specific workflows.

Before acting on a recurring request:

1. Search by intent, target, and expected outcome rather than exact wording.
2. Read the smallest relevant workflow note.
3. Check its scope, preconditions, status, and last-verified date.
4. Reuse it only when the current project, environment, tools, and permissions still match.
5. Treat current source code, current tool behavior, and explicit user instructions as authoritative when older knowledge conflicts.

After a workflow succeeds, capture it only when it has likely future value. Keep one concise note with:

- Status
- Scope
- Trigger phrases
- Intent
- Preconditions
- Steps
- Verification
- Failure or revision notes
- Last verified date

If the user reports that a workflow did not work, do not mark it verified or create a duplicate. Preserve the failure reason, revise the existing note, and record the replacement only after verification. Never store full transcripts, credentials, secrets, one-off requests, or unverified guesses.

## Knowledge Vault Migration

When the legacy `~/Documents/ObsidianVault/` directory exists and `~/Documents/KnowledgeVault/` does not, and the user explicitly authorizes the migration:

1. Verify the source is a directory and the destination does not exist.
2. Rename only the vault directory; preserve all notes and hidden vault metadata.
3. Update only the Obsidian application's saved vault path when explicitly authorized.
4. Never rename, move, or modify the Obsidian application installation or unrelated application folders.
5. Verify the destination, note count, and saved path after the rename.

If the destination already exists, do not merge directories automatically; report the conflict and ask before proceeding. GENTJIN installation may perform this same guarded migration only after explicit user approval, and only when Obsidian is closed.

## Vault Initialization

GENTJIN uses one canonical vault architecture.

If the project vault does not exist, initialize the canonical structure automatically.

If it already exists:

- Preserve all existing knowledge.
- Never reset or recreate the vault.
- Create missing canonical directories when needed.
- Preserve additional user-created directories and notes.
- Never delete or overwrite existing knowledge merely to normalize structure.

Do not create empty notes solely to populate directories.

## Canonical Vault Structure

```text
<project-identifier>/
├── 00-Home.md
├── memory-index.md
│
├── project/
│   ├── overview.md
│   ├── structure.md
│   ├── stack.md
│   ├── commands.md
│   └── state.md
│
├── architecture/
│   ├── modules/
│   └── decisions/
│
├── knowledge/
│   ├── concepts/
│   ├── patterns/
│   └── glossary.md
│
├── issues/
│   ├── bugs/
│   ├── enhancements/
│   └── questions/
│       └── archive/
│
├── work-in-progress/
│   ├── current.md
│   └── archive/
│
├── sessions/
├── changes/
├── attempts/
├── reports/
├── workflows/
└── _templates/
```

Use this architecture consistently across GENTJIN-managed project vaults.

Do not create deeper directory structures unless the project's scale clearly requires them.

## Note-First Workflow

Before answering a project-specific question or making significant implementation changes:

1. Identify the problem or development area.
2. Search relevant project knowledge by meaning or scenario rather than exact wording.
3. Read only the notes relevant to the current task and their meaningful wiki links.
4. Inspect current source code and schemas.
5. Reuse recorded decisions, patterns, or solutions when they still match the current implementation.
6. If stored knowledge conflicts with current source code, treat the current implementation as authoritative.
7. Correct outdated knowledge after verifying the new behavior.

Do not load the entire vault.

Prefer:

`Search → Relevant Notes → Current Source/Schema → Work`

Knowledge priority:

`Current Source/Schema → Accepted ADRs → Architecture → Modules → Patterns → Concepts → Issue History → Active WIP → Questions → Sessions → Reports`

## Project Memory

`project/` answers "what is this repository?" so a later session does not
rediscover structure, stack, and commands that are already known.

| Note | Stores |
| --- | --- |
| `project/overview.md` | Name, type, repository, purpose, primary areas, important entry points |
| `project/structure.md` | Repository layout, directory responsibilities, important relationships, relevant conventions |
| `project/stack.md` | Verified runtime, frontend, backend, database, infrastructure, tooling |
| `project/commands.md` | Verified install, development, build, test, lint, and type-check commands |
| `project/state.md` | Project id, repository, default branch, detected files, known roots, last verified commit/branch, known uncertainty |

Create `project/` lazily. When a project vault has no `project/`, create it on
first use, and create only the notes that were actually established. Do not
create it for every project automatically, and never delete or overwrite
existing notes to add it.

First-time exploration should be targeted and compact: purpose, stack, major
roots, entry points, primary module relationships, and commands. Do not attempt
to document every file.

Store only verified content. Commands come from package files, scripts,
documentation, or a successful run. Never invent commands or technologies.

Each note starts with `Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD`. Add `Last verified commit:`
and `Last verified branch:` in `project/state.md` when Git is available. These
are staleness hints only and must never trigger an automatic full rescan.

Keep `project/` describing the current known state. History belongs in
`sessions/`, `issues/`, `reports/`, and `work-in-progress/archive/`.

### Retrieving Project Memory

Before broadly exploring a project:

1. Resolve the current project knowledge root.
2. Check whether `project/` already exists.
3. Read only the notes relevant to the current task.
4. Verify only the paths the task will touch.
5. Update the note whose durable content changed, and nothing else.

Re-explore an area only when a referenced path no longer exists, current source
contradicts stored memory, the memory is insufficient for the task, or the user
asks for a fresh project-wide exploration. Do not re-discover the framework,
re-map every directory, or re-read unrelated modules during ordinary feature
work.

Reuse before creating. Update `project/structure.md` rather than adding
`project-structure-2.md`, `project-structure-new.md`, or `structure-final.md`.

Precedence when memory conflicts with reality:

`Current source/schema → Current project configuration → Verified project memory → Older notes`

Trust the current code, decide whether the memory is stale, then correct the
memory when the new information is durable. Do not preserve an incorrect note
merely because it already exists.

## Memory Index

Maintain a compact `memory-index.md` at the project vault root so a session can
learn what knowledge exists without opening every note.

Its only job is answering "what knowledge exists, and where is it?". One line
per topic:

```md
# Memory Index

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Project

- [[project/overview]] — project purpose and major areas
- [[project/structure]] — repository structure
- [[project/stack]] — technology stack
- [[project/commands]] — verified project commands

## Current Work

- [[work-in-progress/current]] — where we stopped

## Modules

- [[architecture/modules/payables]] — Payables architecture
- [[architecture/modules/authentication]] — authentication flow

## Decisions

- [[architecture/decisions/nullable-paid-date]]

## Known Issues

- [[issues/bugs/payables-timezone]]
```

Keep it bounded:

```text
Topic → canonical note → one-line description
```

Never put note contents, code examples, or history logs in the index. If the
project outgrows one file, split into `indexes/<domain>.md` and link those from
the root index, but only when that is actually needed. Do not create dozens of
index files.

Create the index lazily. A vault without one keeps working; create it when
enough canonical knowledge exists to be worth indexing, and never require a
destructive migration.

Update an index entry when a note's title, location, or meaning changes, and
remove references that no longer resolve. Do not rebuild the whole index on
every change.

## Retrieval Pipeline

Use this order for ordinary work:

```text
User request
      ↓
Resolve project
      ↓
Read memory-index.md
      ↓
Determine intent, module, and time scope
      ↓
Select relevant memories
      ↓
Load the smallest useful set
      ↓
Verify against current source when needed
      ↓
Perform the work
      ↓
Capture durable changes
      ↓
Update the index if the knowledge map changed
```

This replaces broad vault scanning during normal tasks.

### Relevance-Gated Retrieval

Retrieve memory because it matches the task, not because it exists:

```text
Task relevance
  + importance
  + recency when it matters
  + relationship to the current module
  = what should be loaded
```

A request about one module must not pull in unrelated modules, sessions, or
history. Relevance still matters even for the most important knowledge: do not
load everything marked important on every request.

### Progressive Retrieval

Load one step at a time and stop as soon as context is sufficient:

```text
1. read the index
2. read the matching module or feature note
   enough? → work
   not enough → read the related decision, issue, or attempt
   still not enough → search the relevant session history
```

Stop retrieving once sufficient context exists. Do not load ten notes when two
would do.

### Retrieval Budget

Prefer this order, and stop early:

```text
1. work-in-progress/current.md when relevant
2. project overview and structure when needed
3. the exact module or feature note
4. the exact decision, issue, or attempt
5. the most recent relevant session
6. broader history only if still necessary
```

### Deterministic Retrieval First

Start with what is already in the project: project identity, note titles,
Obsidian links, module names, paths, task terminology, and the index
descriptions. Do not introduce embeddings, a vector store, a database, an
external memory service, or a background indexing process. Consider semantic
retrieval only if Markdown-based retrieval proves insufficient in practice.

### Hot and Cold Memory

Temperature is retrieval behavior, not a folder. "Hot" knowledge is what the
current task needs now: current objective, current WIP, project overview,
current task and branch, blockers, the next step, and a recently relevant
module. "Cold" knowledge stays available but is not loaded automatically: old
sessions, resolved bugs, historical changes, superseded decisions, and old
attempts.

Never keep two copies of a note, such as a hot and a cold version of the same
topic. Express temperature through retrieval order and the index, and reuse
existing canonical files such as `work-in-progress/current.md` and
`project/overview.md` instead of creating files that exist only to be "hot".

### Avoiding Memory Explosion

Before creating a note, check whether it will help future work, whether it is
durable, whether a canonical note already covers it, whether it is really
history rather than current knowledge, and whether it could be a small update
to an existing note instead.

Prefer updating a canonical note over producing a new file. Create a note for
every event and the vault stops being searchable.

### Graph Quality

Link notes when the relationship is genuinely useful, such as
`[[Payables]]` → `[[Overdue Cron]]` → `[[Payables Timezone Bug]]` →
`[[Nullable Paid Date Decision]]`. Do not link every note to every other note.
The graph should be navigable along real engineering relationships, not dense
for its own sake.

### Provenance and Verification State

Record where important canonical knowledge came from, so it can be re-verified
later:

```md
## Provenance

Verified from:

- `src/services/payables.service.ts`
- `src/jobs/payables-reminder.ts`

Branch: HC-713-payables
Commit: abc123
```

Alongside provenance, record verification state where staleness matters:

```md
Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD
Verified against: current source
Branch: development
Commit: abc123
```

Focus this on canonical knowledge. Do not require it on historical session
notes.

## Conflicts and Authority

When stored memory disagrees with the repository, never silently trust it:

```text
Conflict detected
      ↓
Current source wins
      ↓
Decide whether the source is the intended current behavior
      ↓
Update the canonical memory
      ↓
Preserve the historical explanation when useful
```

Mark the situation with a simple textual marker rather than building a state
machine:

| Marker | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `STALE` | Memory describes an older version of the project |
| `CONTRADICTED` | Current source directly disagrees with memory |
| `AMBIGUOUS` | Multiple current implementations appear to exist |
| `UNVERIFIED` | Memory exists but cannot currently be confirmed |
| `HISTORICAL` | Intentionally old, retained for recall |

Do not leave two canonical notes making contradictory claims.

Authority order:

```text
Current source/schema/configuration
      ↓
Current verified project state
      ↓
Canonical memory
      ↓
Historical memory
      ↓
Old session context
```

An explicit current requirement from the user may supersede a previously stored
design decision. When that happens, implement the requirement and then update
the stored decision so memory does not contradict the code.

## Briefings and Handoffs

### Start of Day

For "brief me before we start", "what's going on with this project?", "what
were we doing?", or "give me today's starting context", retrieve the project
overview, current WIP, the latest relevant session, recent meaningful changes,
and known blockers, then answer with:

```text
Current Objective
Latest Progress
Important Decisions
Open Issues / Blockers
Remaining Work
Recommended Next Step
```

Keep it concise unless detail is requested, and do not rescan the repository.

### End of Day

For "wrap up today's work", "give me an end-of-day handoff", or "save where we
stopped":

1. inspect today's meaningful work;
2. update `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`;
3. update `work-in-progress/current.md`;
4. update canonical knowledge when durable facts changed;
5. record blockers;
6. record the next step;
7. include relevant Git context when useful;
8. return a short handoff summary.

The handoff must make tomorrow's resume easy. Keep this state current during
milestones as well, so compaction, a closed terminal, or an interruption never
loses the engineering state.

## Memory Cleanup

Occasionally review the vault for:

- duplicate notes;
- orphaned notes;
- broken links;
- stale canonical notes;
- several notes describing the same concept;
- repeated session discoveries that belong in one canonical note;
- superseded information that should be archived or marked `HISTORICAL`.

Cleanup is non-destructive by default. Report what you found and propose the
change; do not delete potentially useful knowledge on your own initiative. Do
not archive a note merely because it is old.

## Knowledge Routing

Route knowledge according to its purpose.

### Architecture

Use `architecture/` for documentation describing how the system currently works.

Examples:

- system architecture
- authentication architecture
- data flow
- API structure
- infrastructure
- major subsystem relationships

Use:

`architecture/modules/`

for durable knowledge about specific modules, domains, or major features.

Use:

`architecture/decisions/`

for Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

### Knowledge

Use:

`knowledge/concepts/`

for important project-specific concepts, terminology, business rules, or domain behavior.

Use:

`knowledge/patterns/`

for reusable implementation patterns, conventions, solutions, and lessons.

Use:

`knowledge/glossary.md`

for concise definitions of recurring project-specific terminology.

### Issues

Use:

`issues/bugs/`

for confirmed broken behavior, regressions, root causes, and verified fixes.

Use:

`issues/enhancements/`

for requested improvements, refinements, optimizations, and non-bug development work.

Use:

`issues/questions/`

only for genuine unresolved investigations.

Do not create a question note for something that can be immediately determined from the current source code.

### Work in Progress

Use:

`work-in-progress/`

for active development state that must survive between sessions.

Examples:

- partially implemented features
- unfinished debugging
- pending verification
- multi-step refactors
- paused development work

Move completed or abandoned WIP notes to:

`work-in-progress/archive/`

when historical context remains useful.

Maintain `work-in-progress/current.md` as the single canonical answer to "what
were we doing, where did we stop, and what is next?". Keep it small: objective,
current status, completed, in progress, remaining, blockers, relevant files,
links to related memory, and one exact next recommended step. It may link to
topic WIP notes when several workstreams run in parallel.

When work is genuinely finished, clear or archive the active state instead of
leaving a misleading `current.md` behind.

## Recall and Briefings

Recognize recall intent from ordinary conversation. The user should not need a
command to ask about previous work.

```text
Recall request
      ↓
Resolve project
      ↓
Determine the requested time or scope
      ↓
Search the smallest relevant set
      ↓
Verify current state when it affects the answer
      ↓
Return a concise briefing
```

Route questions by intent:

| Question | Look in |
| --- | --- |
| What is this project? | `project/` |
| How does this work? | `architecture/`, `knowledge/` |
| Why did we do this? | `architecture/decisions/` |
| What happened yesterday? | `sessions/` |
| What changed? | `changes/`, `sessions/`, Git |
| Where did we stop? | `work-in-progress/current.md`, latest session |
| What went wrong before? | `attempts/`, `issues/` |
| Have we solved this before? | `issues/`, `knowledge/`, relevant sessions |
| Continue our work. | `current.md`, latest session, related canonical memory |
| What is left? | `current.md` |
| What have we done this week? | `sessions/`, `changes/` |

Search the smallest relevant set first, then widen only if the answer is
incomplete.

### Briefing Format

For a general briefing, prefer a compact structure and adapt it to what actually
exists:

```text
Latest Work
Completed
Key Decisions
Issues / Discoveries
Still In Progress
Next Recommended Step
```

Do not fabricate empty sections. For a simple history question, answer directly
instead of forcing the full format. Never dump raw notes unless asked.

### Latest Changes

For "brief me on the last changes", prefer current WIP, then the latest session
note, then change memory, then Git context, then relevant canonical notes.
Distinguish completed, in progress, unfinished, decisions, and the next step.
Do not present an old session as current when Git or `current.md` clearly shows
newer work.

### Time and Timeline

For relative questions such as "yesterday", "this week", or "last Friday", use
dated session and change notes plus Git metadata, and interpret relative dates
against the current local date. When nothing was recorded for the exact day, say
so and surface the nearest relevant session rather than inventing activity.

Compose timeline briefings from `sessions/`, `changes/`, `architecture/decisions/`,
`issues/`, and Git. Do not maintain separate weekly or monthly notes unless they
add real value.

### Resume and Continue

When the user says "continue", "let's continue yesterday's work", or similar:

1. resolve the project;
2. read `work-in-progress/current.md`;
3. read the latest relevant session;
4. retrieve the relevant canonical project or feature memory;
5. verify the current repository state;
6. briefly state the continuation point when useful;
7. continue the work.

Do not broadly rediscover the project first.

### Sessions

Use `sessions/` to answer "what happened while we worked on this project?".

Create `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for meaningful work on a given date. When more
work happens on the same date, update that day's note instead of creating a
second note.

Do not record every action, tool call, terminal command, file read, or
conversation message. Capture only continuity information:

- features or areas worked on;
- meaningful changes;
- important files involved;
- discoveries and architectural findings;
- decisions;
- problems encountered and solutions applied;
- failed approaches worth remembering;
- completed work, unfinished work, blockers, and next steps.

A session note is a historical record. It is not the current state of the
project; that lives in `project/`, `architecture/`, and `knowledge/`.

### Change Memory

Use `changes/` for a meaningful completed change: feature behavior, refactor,
migration, or integration change likely to matter later.

Do not create a change note for a small edit. One note covers one coherent
change, and it should record date, branch, and commit when Git information is
available, plus the summary, reason, areas affected, important files, and the
behavior before and after.

Change notes answer "what materially changed, and what did it replace?".

### Failed Attempts

Use `attempts/` when a rejected or failed approach is worth remembering because
recalling it would prevent repeated wasted work.

Capture meaningful failures only: a rejected architecture, an incompatible
library, an incorrect query strategy, a deployment method that failed durably,
or a fix attempt that caused a regression. For each, record what was tried, what
happened, why it failed, what worked instead, and when to avoid repeating it.

Do not log every failed command. A failed command with no durable lesson does
not belong here.

### Feature Memory

Treat a significant feature or domain as a concept, not only a folder of files.
Keep its note in `knowledge/concepts/` and link it to the parts it spans:

```text
[[Feature]]
├── [[Feature API]]
├── [[Feature Schema]]
├── [[Feature Jobs]]
├── [[Feature Integrations]]
├── [[Decisions]]
├── [[Known Issues]]
└── [[Changes]]
```

Do not force a feature note for small functionality. Use this for meaningful
project domains only.

### Reports

Use `reports/` for generated development reports, audits, reviews, or requested summaries that should remain part of project history.

## Automatic Capture

Capture knowledge when it has likely future value.

Good candidates include:

- architectural decisions
- important implementation decisions
- confirmed bugs and their root causes
- reusable fixes
- recurring implementation patterns
- important project concepts
- non-obvious business rules
- meaningful enhancements
- unresolved investigations
- significant WIP state

Do not create notes for trivial edits, obvious implementation details, temporary observations, or information easily recovered from source code.

Search before creating a note.

If an appropriate topic note already exists, update it instead of creating a duplicate.

Prefer one durable topic note over many small notes describing the same subject.

## Bug and Enhancement Notes

For bug and enhancement notes, preserve the user's original intent near the beginning of the note.

Include only useful sections such as:

- Request / Problem
- Location
- Root Cause
- Change
- Verification
- Reusable Lesson
- Related Notes

Do not force sections that provide no useful information.

A resolved bug remains in `issues/bugs/` because its root cause and solution may be valuable later.

Do not archive bug history merely because the issue is resolved.

## Questions

Create a question note only when:

- investigation must continue later;
- the answer cannot yet be determined confidently; or
- the user explicitly asks to preserve the question.

Use statuses:

- `Open`
- `Investigating`
- `Answered`

When answered:

1. Record the answer.
2. Promote reusable findings to architecture, knowledge, patterns, or another appropriate permanent note when useful.
3. Move the question to `issues/questions/archive/` when it is no longer active.

Do not duplicate the complete answer across several notes.

## Architecture Decision Records

Store ADRs under:

`architecture/decisions/`

Use ADRs for decisions that materially affect architecture, technology, data design, infrastructure, security, or long-term implementation direction.

An ADR should normally contain:

```text
Status
Context
Decision
Reasoning
Alternatives
Tradeoffs Accepted
Consequences
Related
```

A decision note must answer five questions:

```text
What was decided?
Why?
What alternatives were considered?
What tradeoff was accepted?
Is the decision still current?
```

`Status` answers the last question. When the accepted tradeoff is itself
disputed later, record that in a new decision rather than rewriting the old one.

Supported statuses should include:

- Proposed
- Accepted
- Superseded
- Deprecated

Do not rewrite history when a decision changes.

Instead:

1. Preserve the original ADR.
2. Mark it `Superseded` when appropriate.
3. Create or link the newer ADR.
4. Document why the decision changed.

Architecture describes **how the system works**.

ADRs describe **why important architectural choices were made**.

## Home Note

Use `00-Home.md` as the lightweight entry point into project knowledge.

Keep it concise.

It may link to:

- project memory
- architecture overview
- major modules
- important ADRs
- active WIP
- important project concepts
- current investigations

When project memory exists, link it from the home note:

```text
## Project Memory

- [[project/overview]]
- [[project/structure]]
- [[project/stack]]
- [[project/commands]]
- [[project/state]]
```

When continuity memory exists, link it too:

```text
## Current Work

- [[work-in-progress/current]]

## Recent Sessions

- [[sessions/YYYY-MM-DD]]

## Recent Changes

- [[changes/...]]
```

Link `memory-index.md` as the entry point for discovering what knowledge exists.
When the index is scoped into `indexes/`, link those from it rather than from
the home note.

Keep the index maintainable. Do not append an unlimited number of session links
without a sensible recent/history organization.

Do not turn `00-Home.md` into a duplicate of the entire vault.

## Templates

Use `_templates/` for reusable note structures when templates materially improve consistency.

Templates may exist for:

- project memory notes
- the memory index
- ADRs
- bugs
- enhancements
- questions
- WIP
- sessions
- changes
- attempts
- reports

Do not require every note to use a template when a simpler note is sufficient.

## Vault Migration and Normalization

When resolving a project vault:

1. Check whether the canonical vault already exists.
2. Check for clearly equivalent older project vaults only when there is evidence that one exists.
3. Never migrate based only on a similar directory name.
4. Inspect source and destination before migration.
5. Preserve unique useful knowledge and wiki links.
6. Normalize older structures into the current canonical architecture when safe.

Examples:

```text
decisions/     → architecture/decisions/
modules/       → architecture/modules/
concepts/      → knowledge/concepts/
patterns/      → knowledge/patterns/
glossary/      → knowledge/glossary.md
bugs/          → issues/bugs/
enhancements/  → issues/enhancements/
questions/     → issues/questions/
```

Do not blindly move files when equivalent destination knowledge already exists.

Merge knowledge when appropriate instead of creating duplicates.

Never delete an older vault until:

- project identity is certain;
- useful knowledge has been migrated;
- links and important references have been preserved;
- the canonical vault has been verified.

If identity or migration safety is ambiguous, preserve both and report the ambiguity.

## Knowledge Synchronization

After meaningful development work:

1. Determine whether durable project knowledge changed.
2. Update existing notes before creating new ones.
3. Record newly discovered reusable knowledge.
4. Update relevant architecture when system behavior changed.
5. Create or update an ADR when an architectural decision changed.
6. Update bug/enhancement notes with verified outcomes.
7. Update or archive WIP when work reaches a stable state.
8. Keep links between related knowledge when useful.

Do not update the vault merely to record that files were edited.

Capture the **reason, behavior, decision, or reusable lesson**, not a duplicate Git history.

## Consolidation and Durability

When a session discovers durable knowledge, decide whether it is canonical:

```text
Session discovery
      ↓
Durable?
      ├── no  → leave it in the session note only
      └── yes → update the canonical note, keep the session as history
```

Do not require a future session to search months of daily notes to learn the
current architecture.

Never rely on conversation history or on a compaction summary as the only record
of meaningful knowledge. Persist engineering meaning during normal work, keep
`current.md` current enough to resume interrupted work, and update the daily
session note at meaningful milestones. Recover the engineering state, not every
keystroke. See `compaction` for how temporary working context is condensed and
handed off here only when it passes the significance test.

Use Git as supporting evidence: repository, branch, commit, and changed files
give the "what changed on this branch" answers. Notes supply the reasoning
around those changes. Do not copy Git history into the vault.

## Completion Checkpoint

Before a meaningful task is considered finished, evaluate:

```text
Did project structure change?
Did architecture change?
Was a decision made?
Was a durable bug learned?
Was a meaningful feature changed?
Did current WIP change?
Should today's session note be updated?
Is a change note warranted?
```

Update only the notes that apply.

## Quality Rules

Keep project knowledge:

- concise
- topic-based
- searchable
- current
- reusable
- linked when relationships are meaningful

Prefer explaining:

**what → why → consequence**

rather than recording every implementation step.

Do not:

- copy entire source files into notes;
- store large code implementations;
- save full conversations;
- duplicate Git history;
- create duplicate topic notes;
- create notes solely because a folder exists;
- load the entire vault for every task.

Reference source files and use minimal snippets only when they materially help explain the knowledge.

Current source code and schemas remain the primary evidence for current implementation behavior.
